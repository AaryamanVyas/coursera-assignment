                    <p>Based in Madison, Wisconsin, Hair Day is a boutique hair salon that specializes in cut, color and styling. Hair Day also offers makeup and nail services, prides itself on its warm and relaxing atmosphere and is best known for edgy hair colors and on-trend cuts. The salon can only accommodate a small number of coloring appointments each week, so clients need to book far in advance. To keep clients inspired between appointments, the employees share makeup and nail tutorials on the Hair Day website.</p>
